# Reproducible Analyses for Seroplacer Manuscript 

This Github repository contains the reproducible analyses and data for the manuscript titled "Serovar-level Detection of Bacterial Foodborne Pathogens Using Long-read Amplicon Sequencing".

Required files for analysis and pre-built analysis files can be found in the /Files directory on this main page. The Seroplacer Core Files are required for replicating the analysis found in this work, and the Figure 1 and Figure 4 files contain pre-built data which is computationally time consuming to run, in order to save time for replicating results. 

The full reproducible analysis can be found in a pre-rendered HTML file available for each section of the analysis, described below, along with supporting information:
